# MMM
A note-taking tool for structured academic research content.

@Researchers: Keep track of your open questions, reading notes, flashes of insights, informal conversations in the lab or at conferences, negative results, preliminary lemmas, research routemaps, workshop agendas, ... 

@Citizens: access expert information via its structure instead of via its jargon.
