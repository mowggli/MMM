                  <text>12 children with ADHD underwent a toDCS and a sham condition in a double-blind crossover study design conducted in a sleep laboratory. Memory was tested using a 2D object-location task. In addition, 12 healthy children performed the same memory task in their home environment, with no stimulation.</text>

                              <text>To ensure that the home and laboratory conditions were comparable, parents of control children were instructed to provide a quiet room and to take care that no disturbing events happened during the sessions. Moreover, by introducing a learning criterion (60 per cent), we made sure that patients and healthy children ended the encoding session on a comparable level of encoding.</text>
