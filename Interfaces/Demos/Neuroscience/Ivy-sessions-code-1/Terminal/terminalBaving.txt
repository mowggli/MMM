EXPERIMENT 12 children with ADHD underwent a toDCS and a sham condition in a double-blind crossover study design conducted in a sleep laboratory. Memory was tested using a 2D object-location task. In addition, 12 healthy children performed the same memory task in their home environment, with no stimulation.

CONFOUNDER/LIMIT Differences between healthy children and children with ADHD in memory performance might have been underestimated as the controls performed the tasks and slept at home, not comparable to the settings for children with ADHD.

CHOICE Y
	(6b) How? Please describe your experiment.
EXPERIMENT To ensure that the home and laboratory conditions were comparable, parents of control children were instructed to provide a quiet room and to take care that no disturbing events happened during the sessions. Moreover, by introducing a learning criterion (60 per cent), we made sure that patients and healthy children ended the encoding session on a comparable level of encoding.

DATA 1.Unstimulated children with ADHD displayed worse sleep-dependent memory consolidation than healthy controls. 2.After stimulation, the sleep-dependent memory performance did not differ between children with ADHD and healthy controls. 3.Stimulation did not increase the SO power during the post-stimulation intervals, except in sleep stage 4 epoch. 4 Stimulation did not affect the performance on any control variable (mood, alertness, or working memory performance).
